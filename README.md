## Project

This project was part of my master studies in Artificial Intelligence at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz.
During the Special Topics lecture on audio and music processing from Rainer Kelz, I took part in three challenges:

+ Onset Detection
+ Beat Detection
+ Tempo Detection

## Installation

To install the projects dependencies and create a virtual environment, make sure that your system has python (>=3.9,<3.10) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

Then `cd` into the projects root directory and call: `$poetry install`
